# Architecture

mtld3d is a Wine-side translation layer that ships a D3D9 implementation backed by Metal. The runtime is split across three linkage units that meet at the Wine PE/Unix boundary.

```
test.exe → d3d9.dll → mtld3d.dll → mtld3d.so
(i386 PE)  (i386 PE)  (i386 PE)  (Mach-O, Wine's own arch)

test.exe → d3d9.dll → mtld3d.dll → mtld3d.so
(x64 PE)   (x64 PE)   (x64 PE)   (Mach-O, Wine's own arch)
```

The PE column is fixed by the game; the `.so` follows the arch of the Wine build that loads it (Wine resolves unix libraries out of `lib/wine/<cpu>-unix`), so it is built and shipped for both `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `aarch64-apple-darwin`. An x86_64 Wine loads the first, with the PE side translated by Rosetta 2; an arm64 Wine loads the second and translates the PE side itself (FEX).

- `d3d9.dll` — D3D9 API implementation. COM vtables, caps, state management. Calls Metal-level thunks via its internal `unix_call` caller stub (`windows/d3d9/src/unix_call.rs`).
- `mtld3d.dll` — PE shim. Links winecrt0, owns Wine unix-call globals, exports `mtld3d_unix_call()`. Forwards every cross-boundary call from `d3d9.dll` into `mtld3d.so`.
- `mtld3d.so` — native macOS side. Pure Metal abstraction layer: thunks expose Metal operations only, no D3D9 knowledge.
- `mtld3d-core` — pure-Rust rlib linked into `d3d9.dll`. Host-testable.
- `shared` — PE↔Unix wire-format definitions plus cross-linkage-unit helpers.
- `types` — D3D9 type definitions (vtables, caps structs) shared between d3d9 and tests.

## Workspaces and crates

Two Cargo workspaces, one per target platform: `windows/` builds the PE side for `i686-pc-windows-msvc` and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `unix/` the Mach-O side for `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `aarch64-apple-darwin` (the latter is also the native test target). Open each in its own editor window for rust-analyzer to work.

| Crate               | Workspace  | Output                                                 |

| `mtld3d`            | `windows/` | `mtld3d.dll`, the shim                                 |
| `mtld3d-core`       | `windows/` | rlib linked into `d3d9.dll`                            |
| `mtld3d-types`      | `windows/` | rlib, D3D9 type definitions shared with the tests      |
| `mtld3d-tests`      | `windows/` | the end-to-end suite                                   |
| `mtld3d-unix`       | `unix/`    | `mtld3d.so`                                            |
| `mtld3d-shared`     | `unix/`    | rlib shared by `d3d9.dll`, `mtld3d.dll` and `mtld3d.so` |
| `mtld3d-conformance`| `unix/`    | the conformance runner                                 |

`mtld3d-core` holds every platform-independent helper (DXSO to MSL emission, the render-pass state machine, the slab allocator, format / FVF / vertex-decl / dirty-rect math, fixed-function state) and compiles for the macOS host as well as PE, so `cargo test -p mtld3d-core --target aarch64-apple-darwin` runs its unit tests natively instead of through Wine.

`mtld3d-shared` is the crate every linkage unit depends on, primarily for the PE/Unix wire format (the `Command` enum, the `Thunks` enum, param structs, typed `mtl::` wire values). Pure data and pure-Rust helpers only, no FFI and no `#[link]`, so both workspaces can depend on it cleanly. The internal crates are path dependencies and are not published to crates.io.

## Threading model

The API thread (the game's calling thread) is the bottleneck and must be unblocked fast. Every D3D9 call snapshots the relevant state (cheap u32 copies, vertex memcpy) into a closure and pushes it onto the current frame's op list — no translation, no Metal lookup, no encoding.

A dedicated **encoder thread** (one per device, `sync_channel(1)` backpressure) does the real work. On `Present()`, the API thread sends the accumulated frame and immediately starts collecting the next. The encoder thread runs each closure with mutable access to a `FrameEncoder` that owns persistent caches (pipeline states, depth/stencil states) and translates D3D9 → Metal commands into a fixed-size array.

A dedicated **submit thread** (one per device) executes the `SubmitFrame` thunk — the cross-boundary command replay, the `nextDrawable` wait, present, and commit — overlapping the encoder's build of the next frame. The frame crosses as an owned `FramePayload` holding every buffer the thunk aliases by raw pointer; two payloads ping-pong over a cap-1 work channel, so render-ahead is bounded at one frame. Rare synchronous submits (`Reset`, mid-frame flushes, GPU capture) first drain the submit thread to idle, then run the thunk inline on the encoder thread — the two paths never call `SubmitFrame` concurrently and present order is preserved.

A **log thread** (one per process) is the only thread that thunks for logging. d3d9.dll's `env_logger` sink pushes each formatted line onto an unbounded channel and returns, so a log line costs the API and encoder threads an allocation and a queue push; the log thread drains the queue and forwards every line through the `WriteLog` thunk into the process's log file, which the unix side owns and its own logger and crash handler write too. The thread starts from the first `Direct3DCreate9`, never from `DllMain` (loader lock), after the resolved `mtld3d.conf` has named the file's location through the `OpenLog` thunk; lines logged before that wait in the queue on the PE side and in the file sink's backlog on the unix side, so the file starts with the identity lines.

```

## Thunk vs Command

Two paths cross the PE/Unix boundary:

- **Command** = `MTLRenderCommandEncoder` method. Closures accumulate commands into a fixed-size array; `submit()` sends the whole array in one `unix_call(SubmitCommandBuffer)` and the unix side replays them inside a render pass. Examples: `setRenderPipelineState`, `setViewport`, `drawPrimitives`, `setFragmentTexture`.
- **Thunk** = everything else (object creation/destruction, texture upload, blit). Individual `unix_call()`.

API-thread thunks are restricted to device lifecycle only (`CreateCommandQueue`, `AttachMetalLayer`, `CreateBackbuffer`, `DestroyCommandQueue`), with one exception: `SetCursorOverlay`, whose handler is a store plus a coalesced main-queue dispatch (about 1-2 µs) and which replaces the `SetCursor` wineserver round trip (~100 µs) a show, hide or cursor change costs on the hardware path. Everything else — texture/sampler/pipeline creation, texture upload, resource destruction — runs on the encoder thread. Metal textures are created lazily on first draw via `FrameEncoder.texture_cache`. Resource cleanup uses closures pushed to the current frame.

Thunks are Metal-level operations, not D3D9 calls. Name thunks after what they do in Metal (`GetDeviceInfo`, `CreateCommandQueue`), not after D3D9 methods. D3D9 logic stays in `d3d9.dll`. Objects with no Metal state (like `IDirect3D9`) are PE-only.

## The cursor overlay window

With `cursor.software` resolved on (the default under HDR), the game's cursor is not a hardware cursor. The PE side keeps a blank HCURSOR realized over the client area and sends the cursor's sprite and visibility through `SetCursorOverlay` from the API thread on every `SetCursorProperties` and `ShowCursor`, pixels attached only for a sprite hash the unix side has not seen. The unix side (`metal/macdrv/cursor_overlay.rs`) stores that state under a mutex, queues at most one apply on the main queue, and does every `AppKit`, Core Animation and Metal operation of the overlay on the main thread: a borderless, click-through `NSWindow` one level above the game window hosting a `CAMetalLayer` in the game layer's format and colorspace, the sprite rendered into it through the present shaders' cursor variants only when the sprite, the layer mode or the EDR headroom changed, show and hide as a sprite or a transparent clear presented to the same layer (removing a surface from above the game layer is free, adding one back costs the game a late present).

Position rides input events: a local `NSEvent` monitor moves the sprite layer on every mouse-moved or dragged event, reading the game window, its level and its client rectangle live rather than from anything latched at attach, so mode-sets, resizes and display moves need no signal from the PE side. The window itself covers the screen the game window is on and is never moved per event: a window frame change makes AppKit re-resolve the cursor for the pointer's location and, with no cursor of ours on offer, set the arrow over the game's blank cursor on every move.

Two things the pointer does without telling the process are handled by a pointer watch installed at attach for every device, so it serves the D3D9 hardware cursor too (a cursor the game sets through user32 alone is outside it). While the game shows its cursor (the hardware path reports visibility through the same thunk), every present checks for the pointer moving with no events reaching the process (a system tool such as the screenshot crosshair has it) and hides the sprite for the duration; with the cursor hidden, the application inactive, or while winemac clips the cursor (read from its application controller), the events stay away by design, mouselook included, and no check runs, and a `SetCursorPos` warp the game made through winemac (its time is on the same controller) counts as the pointer's own legitimate move rather than another process's; the first event afterwards sets a PE-side flag (`cursor_kick_ptr` on attach) that the cursor module answers with its null-then-set kick at the next `WM_SETCURSOR` or `ShowCursor(TRUE)`, because such a tool leaves its own cursor behind and Wine re-applies a cursor only on a handle change. Nothing on the submit or API thread ever waits on that main-thread work.

## Raw pointers across the boundary need stable backing

Commands carry `u64` param fields the unix side dereferences (`setVertexBytes` ptrs, `commands_ptr` inside `PassDescriptor`, the `PassDescriptor` array itself). The backing must not move between hand-out and `unix_call` return.

A growing `Vec<u8>` silently reallocates on capacity growth, invalidating every previously-returned pointer; the unix side then dereferences freed memory, Wine's SEH shim translates SIGSEGV to `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` (`0xc0000005`), and the PE side sees `unix_call` return non-zero. Prefer `Vec<Box<[u8]>>` (one heap block per allocation) or a chunked bump allocator where chunks never move. `FrameEncoder.scratch` is the canonical example.

## `status=0xc0000005` from `unix_call` is a unix-side SIGSEGV

Wine's unix-call dispatcher wraps each handler in a SEH-translation shim. Any `0xc0000005` means the unix side crashed mid-call — the PE side's own early-return error logs (`queue retain failed`, `renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor returned nil`, …) will **not** fire. Diagnose by instrumenting each step of the unix-side path with a log line keyed to what it's doing; the last line printed before the PE-side error is the crash site.

## Shared wire values are typed in `unix/shared/src/mtl.rs`

Any integer crossing the boundary with *symbolic* meaning — Metal enum codes (storage mode, pixel format, compare func, blend factor, primitive type, sampler filter/address, …), bitflag masks (texture usage, color write mask), stage selectors — is declared **once** in `mtl.rs` as a `#[repr(u32)]` enum (single-choice) or `bitflags!` struct (multi-bit). Param fields in `params.rs` use that type directly, *not* `u32`.

**Never** restate the encoding as a local `const`. **Never** write an integer literal at a call site or decode arm.

The three cdylibs are separate linkage units. An untyped integer is a silent-drift risk: PE adds a variant, Unix decode forgets, a `log_once_warn!` covers it. Typed fields move the contract into the shared crate; exhaustive `match` becomes a compile error the instant a variant is added. Sound because `make` / `make install` rebuild and copy all three together — the "unknown variant" UB bit pattern never appears on the wire.

How to apply:
- New thunk field with symbolic meaning → `mtl::` type. Sizes/offsets/counts/`!= 0` booleans → `u32`.
- Adding a value: extend `mtl.rs`, extend `d3d_to_metal_*` if one exists, the compiler points at every Unix-side match site.
- Bit-flag fields use `bitflags!` (`TextureUsage`, `ColorWriteMask`).
- `Command::param_a/b/c/d` carry polymorphic `u32`s whose meaning depends on `Command::cmd`. Stay `u32` on the struct; encode via `Enum::Variant as u32` in the `Command::foo` constructor and decode via `Enum::from_repr(raw)` (strum `FromRepr`) in the dispatcher — never a bare `match raw { 0 => …, 1 => …, … }`.

## The drawable is the layer's size, and present owns the resample

The windowed back buffer keeps the dimensions the application requested until
an explicit `Reset`. A `WM_SIZE` changes the presentation destination only;
it must not recreate game surfaces or change the viewport and scissor. This
lets applications with a fixed rendering resolution resize their window and
move between displays without losing content or changing coordinate systems.

`CAMetalLayer.drawableSize` is kept at the layer's own `bounds × contentsScale`, never at the guest's back-buffer size. `macdrv::sync_drawable_size` pushes it at attach and again before every `nextDrawable`, because the documented default is captured once and does not follow the layer: a freshly created wine metal view reports a real `bounds` beside a `0x0` `drawableSize`, and a window resize moves `bounds` without moving `drawableSize`.

That is what makes the composite pass a 1:1 copy. A drawable that is not the size of the layer's backing store gets rescaled by the compositor, on top of whatever present already did, and the phase of that second resample is not ours to control: a ratio near 1.0 shows up as the whole frame, interface included, sitting a pixel off where it was drawn. Re-syncing per present rather than per `Reset` is what covers the frames between a window resize and the guest reacting to it. The same reasoning is why `contentsGravity` is inert here rather than load-bearing.

So every back-buffer-to-drawable difference is resolved in `submit_frame`, by exactly one of three routes (`present_route` in `command.rs`): a 1:1 blit at matching extents, `MTLFXSpatialScaler` when the drawable is larger in both axes and the GPU has MetalFX, and the present shader's filtered stretch for everything else. Only the third covers any ratio, so it is also the backstop when a scaler declines — `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` cannot resample, and a partial copy would leave the rest of the drawable undefined.

## Adding new thunks

1. Add variant to `Thunks` enum in `mtld3d-shared` `lib.rs` (count and iteration via strum).
2. Add param struct in `mtld3d-shared` `params.rs` (`#[repr(C, align(8))]`). Field types: `u64`, `u32`, `#[repr(u32)]` enums from `mtl::`, or `bitflags!` structs from `mtl::`. Symbolic-meaning integers must use `mtl::`. `impl Thunk` with the matching code.
3. Add handler in `mtld3d-unix`, add arm to `dispatch()` (exhaustive match = compile error if forgotten).
4. Call via `unix_call(&mut params)` from `d3d9`.

## Label every Metal object created

Every `MTLDevice.new*…`, `MTLCommandQueue.commandBuffer()`, `MTLCommandBuffer.{render,blit}CommandEncoder*`, and per-stage descriptor that produces a Metal-side state object must get a `setLabel:` call before it's handed back across the boundary or used. Strings start with `mtld3d-` followed by the role and an identifying suffix — `mtld3d-tex-{tex_id:#x}`, `mtld3d-vbib-{buffer_id:#x}`, `mtld3d-frame-{submit_seq:#x}`, `mtld3d-pass-{idx}`, `mtld3d-samp-{key:#x}`, `mtld3d-backbuffer`, `mtld3d-depth`, `mtld3d-readback`, `mtld3d-mipgen`, …

Xcode GPU frame captures, Metal validation logs, and the Metal HUD display these labels everywhere they show a Metal object. Without them every handle shows up as `Buffer (8KB)` / `RenderCommandEncoder` / `Texture (BGRA8 1024×1024)`, which makes any handle-recycle / cross-device-alias / contention investigation start with "and which one is this?". With them the mapping back to a mtld3d-side identity (`TextureId` / `BufferId` / `submit_seq` / pass index / packed-bits state key) is one column in the resource browser.

How to apply:
- For *create-style* thunks (texture, buffer, sampler, DSS), the param struct on the PE side carries an `id: u64` (and a `kind` enum where one struct serves multiple roles, e.g. `BufferKind` on `CreateBufferParams`). PE side fills it from the appropriate strong-typed identifier (`tex_id.raw()`, `buffer_id.raw()`, `SamplerKey::raw()`, `DepthStencilKey::raw()`); unix side composes the label string and calls `setLabel`.
- For *per-frame* objects created entirely on the unix side (the per-frame `MTLCommandBuffer`, per-pass `MTLRenderCommandEncoder`, blit encoders, mipgen + readback transients), label inline at the create site using whatever in-scope identity disambiguates instances (`SubmitFrameParams::submit_seq`, the `pass_idx` loop variable, a static role string).
- For *descriptor-then-state* paths (`MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor`, `MTLSamplerDescriptor`, `MTLDepthStencilDescriptor`), call `setLabel` on the **descriptor** before the `newXxxStateWithDescriptor:` call — the label propagates onto the resulting state object.

Trait-import caveat: `setLabel` lives on different traits depending on the object. `MTLBuffer` / `MTLTexture` / `MTLSamplerState` / `MTLDepthStencilState` need `use objc2_metal::MTLResource;`. `MTLRenderCommandEncoder` / `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` need `use objc2_metal::MTLCommandEncoder;`. `MTLCommandBuffer` and `MTLCommandQueue` provide it on their own protocol traits, no extra import.

Cost: one `format!` + one `NSString::from_str` + one objc dispatch per create call. Negligible — paid only at object-create time (cache miss / per-frame at most). Ship unconditionally; never gate on `cfg(debug_assertions)`.

## Logging

Every crate logs via `log` + `env_logger`. All targets sit under `mtld3d::*` and `env_logger` matches by `::`-separated prefix, so `RUST_LOG=mtld3d=warn` is the single switch for the whole project; unset, everything logs at `info`. Levels: `info!` for one-shot milestones, `warn!` for unimplemented stubs and fallback paths, `error!` for unexpected internal failures, `trace!` for per-call breadcrumbs, `debug!` for routine per-call noise useful in deep debugging.

| `mtld3d::unix::depth`     | comparison-sampler creation, the unix mirror of `d3d9::depth` (trace)    |

Each cdylib initializes the logger independently and idempotently; `mtld3d.so` has no owning entry point, so `d3d9.dll` dispatches a one-shot `InitLogger` thunk from its init path. Every line goes to the process's log file, `<exe>-<pid>.log` under `mtld3d-logs` beside the executable (`log.dir` moves it), never to the standard streams: a game a launcher spawned has no usable ones. `<pid>` is the macOS process id, so a launch never overwrites the log of the one before it; the directory keeps the ten newest logs and the ten newest traces, and the file appears with the first line written, so a process that logs nothing leaves nothing behind.

### F12: three-frame dump and GPU capture

Pressing F12 in a game records the next three frames twice over. The log gets one `[dump]` line at info level for every D3D9 event of those frames that a GPU trace cannot show: render-target, depth-stencil, viewport and scissor changes, clears, surface copies, occlusion query traffic, and every draw with the states that decide its pass shape, its shaders and its textures. At the same time a Metal GPU trace of the same frames lands beside the log file as `<exe>-<pid>-<n>.gputrace`, numbered per press; the process needs `MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1` in its environment for that half, otherwise the log says so and the dump still runs. The two sides name each other: each `frame end` line carries the label of the frame's command buffer, and every dumped draw sits in a `draw N` debug group in the trace, so `gpudebug`'s `find` or Xcode's search lands on it directly.

## Perf infrastructure

The `mtld3d::perf` summary in `windows/core/src/perf.rs` is compiled in only on a `PERF=1` build (`cfg(perf_tracking)`) and emits a multi-line report every 5 s at `info!` under `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::perf=info`. Counters group by which thread owns them (API, encoder, GPU wait); subtimers indent under their parent. Banner shows `bottleneck=…` based on `present_block` share + `gpu_wait` vs `enc_cpu`; the four terminal buckets are echoed on a `buckets:` line for auditability. The same Info gate also enables the per-call cycle accounting — single switch. Pass / workload shape (per-pass dump, `present_texture=…` audit line, per-RT pair stats) lives on the separate `mtld3d::d3d9::passes=trace` switch — those are diagnostics, not perf metrics.

Counter aggregation — mixing these up misreads the log:

- **Time counters** (anything ending in `ms`): per-frame averages.
- **Event counters** (passes, commands, draws, fresh, discards, wraps, …): raw window totals — divide by `frames=N` for a rate. Never average an event counter — silently rounds rare signals to zero.
- **Depth counters** (retention depth, retention KB): f64 averages, formatted `.1`.
- **Cache-size snapshots**: point-in-time at window emit, neither averaged nor summed.
- **Peak counters** (`peak …` cells): max value on any single frame in the window.

No ANSI colour anywhere: every line goes to the process's log file, and `env_logger` is told so (`WriteStyle::Never`) rather than left to auto-detect a terminal, which under Wine would be wrong in both directions.

### Don't hand-roll `rdtsc()` brackets — use `perf::ApiTimer` / `CycleSetTimer` / `CycleAddTimer`

Time measurements that flow into the perf summary go through one of:

- `ApiTimer` — D3D9 vtable entry brackets, accumulates into `api_cycles_by_category[Category]`.
- `CycleAddTimer` — sub-scope inside an outer `ApiTimer`, accumulates into a `*mut u64` field (e.g. `query_wait_cycles`).
- `CycleSetTimer` — once-per-frame measurement that overwrites a `*mut u64` field (e.g. `present_block_cycles`, `op_cycles`, `submit_cycles`, `drawable_wait_tsc`).

All three gate on a static `PERF_TRACKING_ENABLED: AtomicBool` latched once at logger init from `log_enabled!(target: "mtld3d::perf", Level::Info)`. When perf isn't being reported the helpers cost ~1 ns per call (one `Relaxed` atomic load + branch); when it is, the cached load avoids the per-call env_logger filter walk — the level chosen for the latch (Info) is paid once at init, not per call. On a non-`PERF` build the helpers compile to nothing (`cfg(perf_tracking)`).

The summary itself emits at `info!` on the same target, so the user-facing switch on a `PERF=1` build is a single `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::perf=info` for both the cycle accounting and the rendered grid.

A second cached gate, `PAIR_STATS_ENABLED`, latched from `log_enabled!(target: "mtld3d::d3d9::passes", Level::Trace)`, fronts `bump_pair_stats` and the per-pass / `present_texture=…` / per-RT pair lines that `log_frame_summary` appends after the grid. Those are pass-shape and workload-shape diagnostics — they ride the same `mtld3d::d3d9::passes` target as the per-event pass-break / pass-open probes in `windows/core/src/passes.rs`, not the perf target.

The unix `.so` carries its own `PERF_TRACKING_ENABLED` + `CycleSetTimer` (in `metal/command.rs`) — each cdylib has its own `log` statics so the cache is per-runtime. Each cdylib calls its own `init_tracking_enabled` from logger init.

The two legitimate raw-`rdtsc()` use cases are (a) inside `mtld3d-core::perf` — the helpers themselves, frame/window boundary timestamps, calibration in `tsc.rs` — and (b) rdtsc as a *clock argument*, not a bracket — e.g. `BurstTracker::poll(now, …)` in shader-compile debounce.

## Debugging rendering bugs — shader/pass toolkit

Four off-by-default knobs answer "which shader on which RT produced the bad pixels":

1. **Pass × shader correlation log** — `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::d3d9=debug`. One `debug!` line per unique `(RT size, VS, PS)` triple; shaders tagged `prog 0x…` (content-hash, stable across runs) or `ff 0x…`. Implementation: `FrameEncoder::maybe_log_pass_shader` from `draw::emit_draw`.
2. **MSL dumps** — `RUST_LOG=mtld3d::dxso=trace`. Bracketed by `── VS MSL prog 0x… ──` / `── /VS MSL prog 0x… ──` (and PS).
3. **Raw DXSO bytecode dump** — `debug.bytecodeDumpDir = /tmp/mtld3d_shaders` in `mtld3d.conf`, or one-shot via `MTLD3D_CONFIG="debug.bytecodeDumpDir=/tmp/mtld3d_shaders"`. Writes raw LE `u32` token streams to `{vs|ps}_{id:x}.dxso` on `Create*Shader`. Idempotent per id.
4. **Offline disassembler** — `cd windows && cargo run --example disasm --target aarch64-apple-darwin -- /tmp/mtld3d_shaders/ps_<id>.dxso`. Prints raw tokens, parsed IR (`{:#?}` on `DxsoProgram`), and emitted MSL. Host-only, no Wine.

Typical workflow:

```sh
RUST_LOG=mtld3d=warn,mtld3d::d3d9=debug,mtld3d::dxso=trace MTLD3D_CONFIG="debug.bytecodeDumpDir=/tmp/mtld3d_shaders" ./<game>.exe > /tmp/trace.log 2>&1
```

Reproduce → grep `pass RT` for suspect ids → grep `── PS MSL <id>` for emitted MSL → `cargo run --example disasm` for deeper analysis → seed a regression test in `core/src/dxso/emit_tests.rs`.

## Debugging heap corruption — `MTLD3D_CRUMB=1` mmap breadcrumb

`unix/shared/src/crumb.rs` is a zero-I/O crash breadcrumb mapped at `Z:\tmp\mtld3d-crumb.bin` (= `/tmp/mtld3d-crumb.bin` under Wine). Probe calls compile to a single `mov [ptr], rax` when enabled and to nothing when disabled.

```sh
MTLD3D_CRUMB=1 make install   # cfg routed through build.rs
./<game>.exe                  # reproduce
xxd /tmp/mtld3d-crumb.bin     # read last-recorded state
```

`MTLD3D_CRUMB=1` is used instead of `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg mtld3d_crumb"` because cargo prefers env `RUSTFLAGS` over `[target.*.rustflags]` (does not merge), so the env approach silently drops xwin `-Lnative=…` paths. `windows/d3d9/build.rs` reads `MTLD3D_CRUMB` and emits the cfg through `cargo:rustc-cfg`, which composes correctly. The other way to add a flag without losing the config-file ones is a `--config` layer, which cargo *does* join into the existing array; that is how the Makefile's `FP=1` appends `-C force-frame-pointers=yes`.

Slot layout (8 bytes each, 128-byte map):

| Off | Writer | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `0x00` | encoder | `(frame << 32) \| op_idx` |
| `0x08` | encoder | `Phase` tag (see `Phase` enum in `crumb.rs`) |
| `0x10` | API | `(ApiMethod << 56) \| (level << 48) \| (flags << 16)` for the last Lock/Unlock |
| `0x18` | API | pointer returned to the game from that Lock |
| `0x20` | any | `(thunk_code << 32) \| (status << 8) \| marker` — `0xEE` mid-call, `0xDD` returned |
| `0x28` | any | `unix_call` `params` pointer at entry |
| `0x30` | API | `(seq << 32) \| (tcc_max << 16) \| tcc_last` — `FfVsKey::tex_coord_count` at draw-snapshot capture |
| `0x38` | encoder | same shape — same field at `emit_vs_ff` dispatch |
| `0x40` | API | address of the captured `&FfVsKey` (PE-side closure storage) |
| `0x48` | encoder | address of the dispatched `&FfVsKey` |
| `0x50` | API | wrapping byte-sum + rotate fingerprint of all FfVsKey bytes at capture |
| `0x58` | encoder | same fingerprint at dispatch — mismatch ⇒ at least one byte changed in transit |

Adding a new probe: define under both `enabled` and `disabled` modules with matching signatures, document the new slot in this table, call directly from the suspect site (no `#[cfg]` at the call site). Single `write_volatile` so the disabled-build optimizer fully elides them. No formatting or syscalls — preserve the zero-cost-when-off contract.
