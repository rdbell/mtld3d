// API and encoder threads, and a per-block virtual mapping for large
// blocks, paid from emulated x86 crossing the PE/unix boundary. snmalloc
// serves from per-thread slabs and never calls HeapAlloc at any size —
// it takes address space from VirtualAlloc directly.
//
// Its lock-free remote-free ring also batches cross-thread frees, though
// not for PageBox: the ring's budget is 16 KiB and a PageBox is at least
// one 16 KiB page, so every box posts on its own. The batching earns its
// keep on the smaller traffic crossing the same boundary (Arc control
// blocks, boxed closures, FrameData internals).
//
// mimalloc is not usable here: its cross-thread free path faults on
// 16 KiB-aligned PageBox allocations.
//
// Under `cfg(mtld3d_crumb)` the allocator is swapped for
// `crumb_allocator::CrumbAllocator` — a thin `SnMalloc` wrapper that
// records PageBox-shape alloc/dealloc events into the shared crash
// breadcrumb. Production builds get plain `SnMalloc` with zero overhead.
