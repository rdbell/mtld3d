//! Display mode and device-window management for a fullscreen device.
//!
//! A fullscreen `CreateDevice` sets the display mode the game asked for
//! through user32, exactly as native D3D9 does, then strips the window's
//! decoration and stretches it over the monitor rect. What it deliberately
//! does **not** do is touch the window's z-order.
//!
//! The mode-set is what keeps the game's coordinate spaces in agreement. A
//! game sizes its rendering and its mouse handling from the mode it picked;
//! with the mode set, the client rect, `GetSystemMetrics`, `GetCursorPos` and
//! every mouse message answer in that mode, so its clicks land where its UI
//! is drawn. (Until 2026-08 the back buffer honored the mode under a
//! monitor-sized window, which left the mouse in monitor space: Half-Life 2's
//! menu missed by the ratio of the two at every sub-native mode.)
//!
//! On Wine the mode-set is meant to be virtual. With `EmulateModeset` on
//! (`HKCU\Software\Wine\X11 Driver`, read by win32u whatever the driver, once
//! per process at start; the launcher and the test prefix set it), win32u
//! leaves the physical display alone, records the mode as the virtual
//! desktop, scales every window rect onto the physical monitor before the
//! driver sees it (uniformly and centred, so a mode of another aspect is
//! letterboxed and the menu bar stays, since the window no longer covers the
//! screen) and maps the pointer back into the mode. The `NSWindow` and the
//! `CAMetalLayer` in it stay display-sized, the back buffer is the mode, and
//! present scales one to the other (`MetalFX` when enlarging), the same
//! resample `render.scale` rides. Without the key Wine's mac driver hands the
//! request to `CGDisplaySetDisplayMode` and the whole desktop switches
//! resolution, which is native behaviour but not what anyone wants on a Mac.
//!
//! Only a settable mode is set, one in the list win32u validates against;
//! the adapter mode table in `direct3d9` is seeded from that list so the two
//! agree by construction, and games enumerate a bounded subset of it. A request that is no display
//! mode at all (native would reject it) follows the client rect instead, and
//! so does a maximized window, where the window manager sizes the window;
//! `render.scale` decides how many pixels are rasterized in those cases. A
//! mode-set user32 refuses anyway falls back to the monitor-covering window
//! with the back buffer at the request, mouse in monitor space, with a
//! warning.
//!
//! The rest of the mode contract follows native: when a fullscreen device
//! loses focus or leaves fullscreen, [`restore_registry_mode`] puts the
//! user's desktop back, and a re-activation sets the mode and re-covers the
//! monitor again. A `CDS_FULLSCREEN` mode-set is also undone by explorer when
//! the process exits, so a crash cannot strand the desktop in the game's mode.
//!
//! The z-order is left to the window manager. Raising the window to the
//! topmost level deadlocks Wine's mac driver: it re-derives the Cocoa window's
//! level and parent while holding winemac's per-window lock and hops to the
//! main thread to do it, so a focus event arriving meanwhile re-enters
//! `NtUserSetWindowPos` on another thread and both stall. See
//! `apply_fullscreen_window`.
//!
//! A device created with `D3DCREATE_NOWINDOWCHANGES` opts out of the window
//! half. The flag hands window management to the app, so the device leaves
//! the window's style, rect and visibility exactly as it found them, in
//! fullscreen as in windowed mode, and never re-covers the monitor behind
//! the app's back. The mode is still set and restored: neither is a window
//! change.
//!
//! Only the primary display is driven, so a device whose window lives on a
//! secondary monitor is covered by the wrong rect. Matching the window's
//! current monitor is a follow-up.
