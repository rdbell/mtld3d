// backbuffer question (`CheckDeviceType` — the CAMetalLayer is hardcoded
// BGRA8 and `d3d9_create_device` substitutes it for a 16-bit request, so a
// 16-bit backbuffer works on every device) and the conversion SOURCE side (a

// even on Apple GPUs: its native Metal format (`ABGR4Unorm`) has a different
// channel order that is corrected with a sampler swizzle, and a swizzle only
// affects reads — render writes would land in the wrong bits — so `A4R4G4B4`
// is a sampling-only format everywhere.

// `A8B8G8R8` and `X8B8G8R8` are the reversed-channel twins of the 32-bit
// family and back Metal's `RGBA8Unorm`, colour-renderable on both GPU
// families, so they are render targets everywhere. `X8B8G8R8` carries the
// same alpha-forcing swizzle `X8R8G8B8` does, which is a sampling-only view:
// a render-target handle is always handed out unswizzled, and the X byte is
// "don't care" on the write side anyway. Neither is a DISPLAY format, so
// `is_present_compatible` keeps them out of the fullscreen backbuffer answer.
// `R8G8B8` is deliberately absent: it has no Metal counterpart at all and is
// widened to BGRA8 by the upload pass, so rendering into it would break the
// same Lock/readback fidelity the expanded 16-bit formats are held out for.
//
// The float family is renderable on every device: Metal's pixel-format
// capability table lists R16Float / RG16Float / RGBA16Float and R32Float /
// RG32Float / RGBA32Float as colour-renderable for both the Apple and the
// Mac2 GPU families, so the answer needs no device query. Linear FILTERING is
// the half that differs, and it is not this predicate: the half-float members
// filter everywhere, while the single-precision three depend on
// `MTLDevice.supports32BitFloatFiltering`, which `CheckDeviceFormat` answers
// from the device for `D3DUSAGE_QUERY_FILTER`
// (`format::supports_usage_query`). Engines that render HDR internally (an
// off-screen float scene target, their own tone-map into the 8-bit
