//! The D3D9 cursor: a hardware HCURSOR, or a blank one under the software overlay.
//!
//! Implements `D3D9Device::SetCursor*` / `ShowCursor` / `CursorWndProc` so
//! games that rely on the Win32 cursor (hiding the OS pointer while they
//! render their own sprite over it) actually get the behaviour they expect.
//!
//! **Per-window back-pointers.** `CallWindowProcW` can't pass per-device user
//! data through, so the subclass maps each window's `HWND` to its owning
//! `DeviceInner` in `DEVICE_INSTANCES`. Two devices may exist at once, and a
//! single global back-pointer would be wrong the moment they do, so the lookup
//! is keyed by the window the message arrived on.
//!
//! **Software mode.** With `cursor.software` resolved on, the game's cursor is
//! drawn by the unix side in an overlay window: `SetCursorProperties` ships the
//! upscaled bitmap through the `SetCursorOverlay` thunk, `ShowCursor` ships the
//! visibility, and the Win32 cursor this module realizes is a blank HCURSOR, so
//! the `WindowServer` cursor plane never toggles on our account.
