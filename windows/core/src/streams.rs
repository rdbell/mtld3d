//! D3D9 vertex-stream frequency: the `SetStreamSourceFreq` contract and what draws derive from it.
//!
//! A frequency word is `flags | count`. `D3DSTREAMSOURCE_INDEXEDDATA` marks a
//! per-vertex stream of an instanced draw and, on stream 0, carries the
//! instance count; `D3DSTREAMSOURCE_INSTANCEDATA` marks a per-instance stream
//! whose count is the number of instances that share one element. The
//! validation rules and the instance-count derivation follow the D3D9
//! runtime's observable behaviour.
