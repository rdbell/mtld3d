//! Typed FFI-boundary references.
//!
//! Every untyped pointer that crosses an FFI seam (COM vtable `this` on the
//! PE side, unix-call handler params, typed in/out C struct pointers) is
//! wrapped in a zero-cost newtype defined here. The newtype constructor is
//! `unsafe fn` — that is the **one** place a caller asserts the ABI contract
//! (alignment, validity, lifetime). Methods on the newtype are safe because
//! the invariant is type-encoded and the abstract lifetime `'a` is bound to
//! the call frame via `PhantomData<&'a …>`, preventing escape.
//!
//! A safe `pub fn` that accepts an arbitrary raw pointer and hands back a
//! reference synthesises an unbounded lifetime, which is unsound by strict
//! Rust convention; the constructors here are `unsafe fn` for that reason.
//! The analogous stdlib primitives — [`core::slice::from_raw_parts`],
//! [`Box::from_raw`](std::boxed::Box::from_raw),
//! [`core::pin::Pin::new_unchecked`] — are all `unsafe fn` on the same
//! grounds.
//!
//! Each call site writes its `// SAFETY:` justification at the constructor,
//! derived from the calling ABI (e.g. "`IDirect3DDevice9` vtable guarantees
//! `this` is `*mut Direct3DDevice9` for the call duration"). See
//! `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §"Unsafe is a last resort" for the policy.
