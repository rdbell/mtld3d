//! The software cursor: the game's cursor bitmap drawn in a transparent overlay window.
//!
//! The PE side keeps the Win32 cursor blank while `cursor.software` is on and
//! sends the cursor's sprite and visibility through the `SetCursorOverlay`
//! thunk; this module draws that sprite in a borderless, click-through
//! `NSWindow` one level above the game window. The hardware cursor plane is
//! never toggled, and under HDR the sprite goes through the same tone map as
//! the frame, so the cursor is as bright as the UI it hovers over.
//!
//! The window never moves with the pointer: it covers the whole screen the
//! game window is on, and the sprite is a `CAMetalLayer` moved inside it. A
//! window frame change makes `AppKit` re-resolve the cursor for the pointer's
//! location, and with no cursor of our own to offer it lands on the arrow over
//! the game's blank cursor on every mouse move; a layer moving inside a fixed
//! window is invisible to that machinery. Show and hide swap the layer's
//! pixels, a sprite or a transparent clear, so its surface stays in the
//! window's scene: taking a surface out from above the game layer is free,
//! putting one back costs the game's next present a refresh, and a game
//! hiding the cursor while a button is held would pay that on every click.
//!
//! Threads. The thunk runs on the API thread and only writes [`SHARED`] and
//! queues one main-thread apply, coalesced through [`APPLY_PENDING`] so a burst
//! of clicks is one apply of the latest state. Everything that touches
//! `AppKit`, Core Animation or the overlay's Metal objects runs on the main
//! thread: the apply, the mouse-move monitor that repositions the sprite, the
//! activation observers, and the display reconciliation that re-renders the
//! sprite when the layer mode or the EDR headroom moved. Those objects live in
//! a main-thread `thread_local`, which is what makes the split sound without a
//! lock around `Retained` handles.
//!
//! Nothing about the game window is latched: the game `NSWindow`, its level,
//! its client rectangle and its screen are read from the bound view at every
//! event, so in-game resolution changes, windowed/fullscreen switches and
//! display moves need no signal from the PE side.
//!
//! Two things the pointer can do without telling this process, both handled
//! here. A system tool that takes the pointer (the interactive screenshot
//! crosshair) delivers no mouse events to the application while the pointer
//! keeps moving; every present notices the pointer moving away from its last
//! legitimate position with no event since and hides the sprite until events
//! resume. The check is asked only while the game shows its cursor, the
//! application is active and winemac is not clipping the cursor, since in
//! every other state the events stay away from the application by design
//! (an inactive application gets none, mouselook clips the cursor for the
//! drag), and a warp the game made through winemac counts as a legitimate
//! move. And when such a tool ends, the window server shows
//! the standard arrow rather than the cursor Wine set, which Wine never
//! re-applies because its handle did not change; the first event after a
//! capture asks the PE side for its null-then-set kick, which makes Wine
//! re-apply through a handle change. That pointer watch serves the hardware
//! cursor too, so it is installed at attach for every device, overlay or not.
